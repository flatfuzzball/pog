# pog
very basic, ugly and buggy ssg/blogging engine to suit my own needs
my 'instance' is running [here](https://tilde.team/~flat/blog)

## usage:
make a new directory, configure the settings in pog.py, do
```
./pog.py init
```
to post, do
```
./pog.py post -n (post name)
```
write your text, when done, save, close and pick the option you want (post)

to edit a post, do the same thing but
```
./pog.py edit -n (post name)
```

to update for whatever other reason, do
```
./pog.py update
```
